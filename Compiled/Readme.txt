The binaries under this directory are compiled with a modern VC compiler (Visual C++ 2022 to be precise), so they may not work well with old Operating System release.

The projects in the Retroware repository have been designed for Windows 7 / 8 era. So you may want to use Visual Studio 2008 / 2012 to make them work well.
